# 前提准备——区块等类的定义
第一个是CBlockIndex类的定义，该类的作用是作为区块链的表示
```
class CBlockIndex
{
public:
    //! pointer to the hash of the block, if any. Memory is owned by this CBlockIndex
    const uint256* phashBlock;

    //! pointer to the index of the predecessor of this block
    CBlockIndex* pprev;

    //! pointer to the index of some further predecessor of this block
    CBlockIndex* pskip;

    //! height of the entry in the chain. The genesis block has height 0
    int nHeight;

    //! Which # file this block is stored in (blk?????.dat)
    int nFile;

    //! Byte offset within blk?????.dat where this block's data is stored
    unsigned int nDataPos;

    //! Byte offset within rev?????.dat where this block's undo data is stored
    unsigned int nUndoPos;

    //! (memory only) Total amount of work (expected number of hashes) in the chain up to and including this block
    arith_uint256 nChainWork;

    //! Number of transactions in this block.
    //! Note: in a potential headers-first mode, this number cannot be relied upon
    unsigned int nTx;

    //! (memory only) Number of transactions in the chain up to and including this block.
    //! This value will be non-zero only if and only if transactions for this block and all its parents are available.
    //! Change to 64-bit type when necessary; won't happen before 2030
    unsigned int nChainTx;

    //! Verification status of this block. See enum BlockStatus
    uint32_t nStatus;

    //! block header
    int32_t nVersion;
    uint256 hashMerkleRoot;
    uint32_t nTime;
    uint32_t nBits;
    uint32_t nNonce;

    //! (memory only) Sequential id assigned to distinguish order in which blocks are received.
    int32_t nSequenceId;

    //! (memory only) Maximum nTime in the chain up to and including this block.
    unsigned int nTimeMax;

```
以上是部分片段，可以看到这里规定了
指向区块哈希的指针
指向上一个区块的指针
指向区块更远祖先的指针
区块的高度
存储该区块的数据文件，本地文件是blk***.dat
区块的状态
区块包含的交易数等
